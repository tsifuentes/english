# English

All following practices helped me to enhance my spoken, written, read, listened english. It is not a method, or the best ones for everybody but they worked for me as habits until now!

Don't be shy! Native or English speakers will realize when you are a beginner so they are tolerant. Find many ways to say: "Could you repeat please?" :D

Relax and enjoy learning a new Language! once you get it, you will want to learn a one more, French, Portuguese, Chinese, so on... ;D

Practices
- Read an article aloud: no matters if you do not understand all words, you will identify them progressively
- Listen an English audio as many times as you can and write every word you can understand, then check with the script: Start with basic conversations, speach, etc.
- Record your meetings in English, then listen them as many times as you can, you can put in practice the previous excercise
- Watch a movie with scripts
- Sing an English song or many of them, first following scripts and then without them
- Watch series that you love in English
- Practice in a tool 10' to 30' every day, check out "resources"
- Get some dialogs and practice with somebody else, try to understand all sentences, enjoy them!
- Close your eyes, breath for a few seconds and feel that everything is in English when you open your eyes, think that you are using synonomous from Spanish but keep the Spanish words away
- When you do not know a word, find out for the meaning, search for it in Google, if you do not understand then get few examples, only as the last chance, you can translate it
- Speak alone, try to say a speach about what you did the whole day, somebody else can think you are insane but the important thing is that you can practice speaking aloud
- Repeat every sentence you could learn during the day
- Exagerate every word trying to imitate to a native speaker
- If you do not have a chat, any call, or email. Try to write about your day in a paper or in your laptop
- Take a specialty course as your preference fully in English and repeat every section more than once
- Practice all sounds from vowels and consonants
